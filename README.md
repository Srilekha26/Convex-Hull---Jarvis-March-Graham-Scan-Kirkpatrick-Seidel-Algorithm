# Convex-Hull---Jarvis-March-Graham-Scan-Kirkpatrick-Seidel-Algorithm
Implementation of Jarvis March, Graham Scan and Krkpatrick Seidel Algorithms to find convex hull. Implementation done in c++.

The above code provides an API for the three algorithms.

Steps to get the results:

1. input the points of the dataset into the file datasets/points.csv
2. in the file main.cpp instantiate the object of the class of algorithm(i.e JarvisMarch/GrahamScan/KPS)
3. compile the main file: g++ main.cpp
4. run the executable: ./a.out
